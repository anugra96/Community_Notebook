# Spatial Community Notebook

Welcome to the Spatial Community Notebook. This project is a full stack application which allows for residents of a community voice their concerns on the map interface as feature points. The application is made of three components: the map, the feed and the note form. The app can be used by local government to survey residents, collect data, respond to service requests etc. 

The map component is a map on which each note submitted by residents is visualized as a point, geolocated to the user's current location or a relevant location of their choice. The feed component lists chronologically of all the notes that are submitted by residents. Users are able to use a filtering interface to filter through the feed by tag or location. Finally the note form component is where residents are able to input their note in a form, where they can tag their note with relevant tags such as "environment", "health", "social" etc).

## Live Demo
